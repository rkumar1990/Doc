An application programming interface (API) is a computing interface that defines interactions between multiple software applications or mixed hardware-software intermediaries.[1] It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees.[2] An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or designed based on an industry-standard to ensure interoperability. Through information hiding, APIs enable modular programming, allowing users to use the interface independently of the implementation.

APIs have their origin in the quest for hardware independence, dating back in concrete form to programming community that formed around the Univac 1108, first introduced in 1964.

Almost all modern hardware processing environments provide some manner of hardware abstraction layer (HAL) to abstract around different products with the same product family, and may extend across multiple product families, so as to ease software migration and software modernization.
